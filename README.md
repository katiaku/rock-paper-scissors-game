# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project is my version of the Rock Paper Scissors game, inspired by the tutorial provided by @whatsdev on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaVNP3nIAv0">freeCodeCamp</a> and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qipq1BV5myU&list=PLkBfv4fGBau8rXtgJn90cAn2JziWATBk1&index=5">YouTube channel</a>.

It challenges players to choose between rock, paper, or scissors and determines the winner based on the rules of the game.
